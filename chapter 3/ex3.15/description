In the AccountTest class of Fig. 3.9, method
contains six statements (lines 13–14, 15–16, 28–29, 30–31, 40–41 and 42–43) that each dis-
play an Account object’s name and balance . Study these statements and you’ll notice that they differ
only in the Account object being manipulated— account1 or account2 . In this exercise, you’ll define
a new displayAccount method that contains one copy of that output statement. The method’s pa-
rameter will be an Account object and the method will output the object’s name and balance . You’ll
then replace the six duplicated statements in main with calls to displayAccount , passing as an argu-
ment the specific Account object to output.
Modify class AccountTest class of Fig. 3.9 to declare the following displayAccount method
after the closing right brace of main and before the closing right brace of class AccountTest :
