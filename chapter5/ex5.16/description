(Bar Chart Printing Program) One interesting application of computers is to display
graphs and bar charts. Write an application that reads five numbers between 1 and 30. For each
number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number of adjacent asterisks. For exam-
ple, if your program reads the number 7, it should display ******* . Display the bars of asterisks after
you read all five numbers.
