(Find the Largest Number) The process of finding the largest value is used frequently in com-
puter applications. For example, a program that determines the winner of a sales contest would input
the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the con-
test. Write a pseudocode program, then a Java application that inputs a series of 10 integers and deter-
mines and prints the largest integer. Your program should use at least the following three variables:
a) counter : A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been
input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).
b) number : The integer most recently input by the user.
c) largest : The largest number found so far.
