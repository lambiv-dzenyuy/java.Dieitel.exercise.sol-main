Exponentiation) Write a method integerPower(base, exponent) that returns the value of
base exponent
For example, integerPower(3, 4) calculates 3 4 (or 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 ). Assume that exponent is a posi-
tive, nonzero integer and that base is an integer. Use a for or while statement to control the calcu-
lation. Do not use any Math class methods. Incorporate this method into an application that reads
integer values for base and exponent and performs the calculation with the integerPower method.
